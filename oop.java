    /** Creating your own classes
     *
     * At the end of this lecture you should be able to :
     *
     * -> Create your own classes
     * ->Declare properties (fields) and methods(actions) for your classes
     *->Use the 'this' keyword to access instance data
     * ->Create and call overloaded methods
     * ->Use access modifiers to control access to class members
     *
     * Defining Your Own Class
     * In java, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects
     * It defines the structure  and behaviour of objects
     * They encapsulate data(attributes)and methods(functions) that operate on that data.
     * Encapsulation involves bundling the data(attributes0 amd methods(function) together within a class
     * Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal implementation details of a class and exposing only necessary functionalities through well-defined
     * It also ensures data integrity and improves code maintainability by restricting direct access to class members from outside the class
     * Methods(also called member functions) define the behaviour of an object.They perform operations on the objects data or provide functionality
     * both attributes and methods are declared within the class definition.
     *

    //Things to take note in the syntax of this session
    // * -> means that there maybe 0 or more occurrences of the line where it was applied
    //<description> indicates that you have to substitute an actual value of this part instead of typing it as it is.
    //[] -> indicates that this part s optional

    //To define a class, we write

    //<modifiers> class <name> {
    //<attributers








    //instance variables
    //Declaring properties (attributes)
    //To declare a certain attribute for our class, we enter

    //<modifier> <Type> <name> [default_value];

    //Coding guidelines
    //i. declare all instance variable right after "public" class
    //ii. Declare one variable for each line
    //iii. Use an appropriate data type for each variable you declare
    //
